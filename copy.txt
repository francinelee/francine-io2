Highlights

This process post is the most thorough of my publicly shareable work. It reimagines the Dropbox Photos experience in a full design cycle: starting with user research, to experience design, to UI prototyping. As featured in Fast.Co Design, Smashing Magazine, and Medium's Top 100. 

Uber x 3 Million
As the sole design resource on a team of 6, I drove the design process for a new growth campaign. We created the promotional cards you might see around in Uber rides today. With 3 weeks, we started with an idea, made quick design iterations based on research, and finished with what’s now one of the highest-performing growth campaigns in the company — and 3 million prints of my work adopted across the country. 


Twitch One-Pager
I consulted with the data science team of 4 to find a solution to their recruiting problem. The solution we designed was a microsite specific to the team. At the end of the 3 weeks, the finished product inspired other teams across the company to create their own microsites, and the data science team exceeded their hiring goals by 200%. 

Dropbox's Core Features
At Dropbox, I managed research projects on our core app, and designed the first research artifact to evangelize our new research team. A major theme of my work here was considering insights at a larger scale: how do we design an experience that eventually affects 300 million users?


Side Thrills
Throwback to the first website I hacked together during a college break: wwww.willworkforamac.com. Definitely not responsive. but it was a successful social experiment + coding challenge in fundraising for my first Macbook. Later, I graduated to frameworks like Bootstrap and Bourbon/Neat, winning an education hackathon with a mentorship platform and later Yammer's Enterprise hackathon with a data visualization app. Not bad, Ma! 


Stuff I'm interested In

Education
I have a degree in Media from UC Berkeley, but my entire design career has been forged from free material on the Internet (thankyou, youtube photoshop tutorials), mentors I've met in the bay area, and bootcamps. I even funded my first Macbook through the Internet. I'm fascinated and grateful for the internet for enabling me to pick a craft from 0. And anything I could do to help make that easier for other people

Always Learning
2015 - I haven't travelled abroad much. I don't understand other cultures. I hope to live in different environments for a bit and see. Not really sure what to expect, just want to understand something by the end of it.
